its been already a few days immersed in this project
while trying to learn more about HTML CSS JavaScript and now React
understading on how to work on things together bul also overwhelmed by the ammount of info to process
from the not much knowlodging on JavaScript, I thought I could make it through but facing a lot of new challenges
from a online course to create your own code from scratch takes a long road
because i am not done with the online courses and still have a lot to learn with them
but the issues of creating my own project i am facing some challenges 
to understand of a bit of vscode, to understand a bit of github, understand a bit of git, to find a bit of code organization, to face some of bugs and new challenges.
