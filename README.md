# random-rainbow-git-diary

Random Rainbow is a project to make random connections of queer video artists. 
this project is also a  diary of my first time making a website .

I am on the beginning of my coding journey and only did some studies on language C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
On this project, I want to go a bit further of the repetition of the projects that I need to be doing on the courses but on create my own code.

I'm at the beginning of my programming journey and I've only done some studies on C language, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In this project, I want to go a little further than repeating the projects I have to do in the courses, but create my own code.
The projects proposed in programming courses are interesting for learning purposes, but they are in a way disconnected from some important points about learning programming.
I recently started a course by a Brazilian programmer, Filipe Deschamps, on his platform curso.dev.
In this course, I was finally able to better understand how to write code and how to make it accessible to other people.
Learning the git hub, gits, and commits is extremely important to learn from the start.
This project is already a second version of the same project in which I was repeatedly working on the files and not dedicating myself to making separate changes to the commits, so now I'm going to use the first version as a reference to build the code from scratch and reorganize the way I was working with the commits.
To take this process a step further, I want to have a diary aspect attached to it so I can write down my thoughts on the code or anything else I think is relevant.
